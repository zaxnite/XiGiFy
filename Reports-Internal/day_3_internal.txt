INTERPRETATION DATA SUMMARY:
------------------------------------------------------------
Efficiency Score: 37.92
Total Energy: 11.75 kWh
Comfort Score: 78.2
Manual Overrides: 4
System Health Events: 1

DETERMINISTIC INTERPRETATION:
------------------------------------------------------------
ENERGY EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS:
The overall energy performance is poor, with an efficiency score of 37.92%. The primary source of energy waste is AC waste during unoccupied periods (0.08) and light waste during unoccupied periods (0.03).

COMFORT & WELLBEING ANALYSIS:
The overall comfort level is adequate, with a comfort score of 78.2.  The primary comfort issue is the suboptimal occupancy-light alignment of 72.9%, indicating potential for improvement.

PREDICTIVE INSIGHTS ANALYSIS:
The system stability is currently showing minor issues due to an upward trend in AC usage.  A medium priority action is recommended to investigate and potentially adjust AC settings.

DETERMINISTIC RULES:
------------------------------------------------------------
ENERGY EFFICIENCY RULES:
  • Rule 1: LOW PRIORITY: Maintain current energy performance given the 37.92% efficiency score and 52% AC usage
  • Rule 2: MEDIUM PRIORITY: Improve occupancy-light alignment to exceed 80% to reduce energy waste
  • Rule 3: LOW PRIORITY: Continue current energy-saving practices with quarterly reviews to maintain the current 37.92% efficiency

COMFORT & WELLBEING RULES:
  • Rule 1: LOW PRIORITY: Maintain current comfort levels given the 78.2% comfort score and stable AC runtime of 0.8
  • Rule 2: MEDIUM PRIORITY: Improve occupancy-light alignment to exceed 75% to enhance comfort and reduce unnecessary energy consumption
  • Rule 3: LOW PRIORITY: Conduct bi-annual monitoring of comfort levels to ensure continued optimal performance at the current 78.2% comfort score
