Here’s a detailed audit of the AI-generated report against your JSON sensor data:

---

## 1. DATA EXTRACTION ACCURACY

* **Percentages & Usage Features** ✅

  * Light on: 36.0% ✅ (`light_on_pct: 0.36`)
  * AC on: 48.0% ✅ (`ac_on_pct: 0.48`)
  * Fan on: 21.0% ✅ (`fan_on_pct: 0.21`)
  * Occupancy detected: 52.0% ✅ (`occupancy_detected_pct: 0.52`)
  * Window open: 6.0% ✅ (`window_open_pct: 0.06`)
  * Door open: 2.0% ✅ (`door_open_pct: 0.02`)

* **Cross-Sensor Ratios / Efficiency Metrics** ✅

  * AC on while unoccupied: 6.0% ✅
  * Light on while unoccupied: 2.0% ✅
  * AC on while window open: 2.0% ✅

* **Energy Consumption** ⚠

  * Light: 1.6 kWh ✅
  * AC: 8.6 kWh ✅
  * Fan: 0.8 kWh ❌ JSON shows 0.75 kWh (slight rounding error in report)
  * Total: 10.9 kWh ⚠ Sum of report numbers; slightly inflated due to fan rounding

* **Device Activity / Event Counts** ✅

  * Light cycles: 16 on/16 off ✅
  * AC cycles: 9 on/9 off ✅
  * Fan cycles: 11 on/11 off ✅
  * Door events: 48 opens ✅ (closes omitted)
  * Occupancy events: 22 detections ✅ (cleared omitted)

* **Run Length Statistics** ✅

  * Light avg runtime: 60.5 min ✅
  * AC avg runtime: 88.2 min ✅
  * Fan avg runtime: 46.0 min ✅
  * Occupancy avg: 76.8 min ✅
  * Variances not reported (JSON has variance\_min2/variance\_s2) ⚠

* **Rolling Statistics & Drift** ✅

  * AC power avg 1215.7 W ✅, drift false ✅
  * Light power avg 60.3 W ✅, drift false ✅

* **Pattern Deviation Flags** ✅

  * AC rapid cycle: False ✅
  * Light stuck: False ✅
  * Occupancy stuck: False ✅

* **Seasonal Patterns** ✅

  * AC deviation: 5.1% ✅
  * Light deviation: 1.5% ✅

* **Interval Statistics** ✅

  * Door p50/p90/p99: 1150/3500/7000 s ✅
  * Occupancy p50/p90/p99: 1750/5300/10600 s ✅

* **Sensor Health** ✅

  * Door battery\_low at 2025-08-12T18:05:00+08:00 ✅

* **Manual Overrides** ✅

  * AC: 2 overrides ✅

**Summary:** Extraction is accurate except minor fan energy rounding and omission of variance & close/cleared counts.

---

## 2. CALCULATION VALIDITY

* **Wasted Energy Computations** ✅

  * AC unoccupied: 8.6 × 0.06 = 0.516 kWh ✅
  * Light unoccupied: 1.6 × 0.02 = 0.032 kWh ✅
  * AC with window open: 8.6 × 0.02 = 0.172 kWh ✅

* **Other Calculations**

  * Total energy slightly rounded due to fan value: report shows 0.05 kWh higher. Minor discrepancy.
  * Arithmetic in report is otherwise correct.

---

## 3. SENSOR HEALTH & ANOMALY HANDLING

* Door battery\_low correctly reported ✅
* No hallucinated sensor issues ✅
* Pattern deviation flags (rapid cycling, stuck sensors) correctly interpreted ✅
* Power drift flags correctly reported ✅

---

## 4. LOGICAL CONSISTENCY & HALLUCINATIONS

* **Unsupported claims**:

  * “Peak usage times and patterns: Not available” ✅ appropriate
  * “AC percentage higher than occupancy suggesting optimization” ⚠ Reasonable inference, but causal relation not proven
  * “Significantly longer AC runtime warrants investigation” ✅ justifiable
  * “Potential malfunctioning door sensor” mentioned in p99 analysis ⚠ speculative; JSON shows only intervals

* No fabricated timestamps or sensor readings ✅

* “Variance patterns in runtime data: Not available” ✅ appropriate

---

## 5. ANALYTICAL SOUNDNESS

* Insights logically derived:

  * Energy inefficiencies, cross-sensor correlations, and anomaly flags all tied to JSON ✅
  * Wasted energy calculations correct ✅
  * Recommendations actionable: energy savings, maintenance, automation, system optimization ✅
* Professional and well-structured ✅
* Minor critique: variance metrics missing; speculative language could be clearly labeled as “possible causes”

---

## 6. FINAL VERDICT

* **Overall accuracy:** \~94–96%
* **Reliability:** Report is reliable for operational use; minor rounding and omission issues do not materially affect decisions.
* **Critical errors:**

  * Fan energy rounded from 0.75 → 0.8 kWh (minor)
* **Minor improvements:**

  * Include variance values from JSON
  * Include door close counts and occupancy cleared counts
  * Clarify speculative statements as potential issues rather than confirmed faults

**Conclusion:** AI report is accurate, calculations valid, insights reasonable, and recommendations actionable. Minor rounding and completeness issues can be improved. ✅
