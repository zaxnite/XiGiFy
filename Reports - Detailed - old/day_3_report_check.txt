Here’s a detailed audit of the AI-generated report against the provided JSON sensor data for 2025-08-13:

---

## 1. DATA EXTRACTION ACCURACY

* **Percentages & Usage Features** ✅

  * Light on: 35.0% ✅ (`light_on_pct: 0.35`)
  * AC on: 52.0% ✅ (`ac_on_pct: 0.52`)
  * Fan on: 25.0% ✅ (`fan_on_pct: 0.25`)
  * Occupancy detected: 48.0% ✅ (`occupancy_detected_pct: 0.48`)
  * Window open: 8.0% ✅ (`window_open_pct: 0.08`)
  * Door open: 3.0% ✅ (`door_open_pct: 0.03`)

* **Cross-Sensor Ratios / Efficiency Metrics** ✅

  * AC on while unoccupied: 8.0% ✅
  * Light on while unoccupied: 3.0% ✅
  * AC on while window open: 3.0% ✅

* **Energy Consumption** ⚠

  * Light: 1.5 kWh ✅
  * AC: 9.4 kWh ✅
  * Fan: 0.8 kWh ❌ JSON shows 0.85 kWh (minor rounding error)
  * Total: 11.8 kWh ⚠ Sum based on rounded fan value; slightly higher than true sum (1.5 + 9.4 + 0.85 = 11.75 kWh)

* **Device Activity / Event Counts** ✅

  * Light cycles: 15 on/15 off ✅
  * AC cycles: 11 on/11 off ✅
  * Fan cycles: 12 on/12 off ✅
  * Door events: 52 opens ✅ (closes omitted)
  * Occupancy events: 19 detections ✅ (cleared omitted)

* **Run Length Statistics** ✅

  * Light avg runtime: 59.8 min ✅
  * AC avg runtime: 85.1 min ✅
  * Fan avg runtime: 48.2 min ✅
  * Occupancy avg: 74.5 min ✅
  * Variances not reported (JSON has variance\_min2/variance\_s2) ⚠

* **Rolling Statistics & Drift** ✅

  * AC power avg 1240.2 W ✅, drift false ✅
  * Light power avg 60.1 W ✅, drift false ✅

* **Pattern Deviation Flags** ✅

  * AC rapid cycle: False ✅
  * Light stuck: False ✅
  * Occupancy stuck: False ✅

* **Seasonal Patterns** ✅

  * AC deviation: 9.2% ✅
  * Light deviation: 1.0% ✅

* **Interval Statistics** ✅

  * Door p50/p90/p99: 1100/3400/6800 s ✅
  * Occupancy p50/p90/p99: 1700/5200/10400 s ✅

* **Sensor Health** ✅

  * Window battery\_low at 2025-08-13T09:15:00+08:00 ✅

* **Manual Overrides** ✅

  * AC: 3 overrides ✅
  * Fan: 1 override ✅

**Summary:** Extraction is mostly accurate; minor rounding for fan energy, variance values missing, door close/occupancy cleared counts omitted.

---

## 2. CALCULATION VALIDITY

* **Wasted Energy Computations** ✅

  * AC unoccupied: 9.4 × 0.08 = 0.752 kWh ✅
  * Light unoccupied: 1.5 × 0.03 = 0.045 kWh ✅
  * AC with window open: 9.4 × 0.03 = 0.282 kWh ✅

* **Other Calculations**

  * Total energy slightly rounded due to fan value: 11.8 kWh vs true sum 11.75 kWh (minor discrepancy)
  * Arithmetic in report otherwise correct.

---

## 3. SENSOR HEALTH & ANOMALY HANDLING

* Window battery\_low correctly reported ✅
* No hallucinated sensor issues ✅
* Pattern deviation flags (rapid cycling, stuck sensors) correctly interpreted ✅
* Power drift flags correctly reported ✅
* No sensor events omitted ✅

---

## 4. LOGICAL CONSISTENCY & HALLUCINATIONS

* **Unsupported claims / speculative statements**:

  * “Infrequent but sometimes lengthy door openings” ⚠ Reasonable interpretation of p99 but speculative
  * “Prolonged meetings or other events” ⚠ Inferred cause; not directly in JSON
  * “Excessive device cycling” correctly noted as data insufficient ✅
* “Peak usage times and patterns: Not available” ✅ appropriate
* Speculative language clearly separated from observed data

---

## 5. ANALYTICAL SOUNDNESS

* Insights logically derived from JSON: ✅

  * Energy inefficiencies, cross-sensor correlations, anomaly flags all supported
  * Wasted energy calculations correct
* Recommendations actionable and tied to findings ✅

  * Occupancy-based shutoff, AC/window rule, maintenance for window battery
* Professional, structured, clear ✅
* Minor critique: include variance values and door/occupancy close counts for completeness

---

## 6. FINAL VERDICT

* **Overall accuracy:** \~95%
* **Reliability:** Report is reliable for operational use; minor rounding and omission issues do not affect decisions materially.
* **Critical errors:**

  * Fan energy rounded 0.85 → 0.8 kWh (minor)
* **Minor improvements:**

  * Include variance metrics from JSON
  * Include door close counts and occupancy cleared counts
  * Clarify speculative interpretations as possible causes, not confirmed events

**Conclusion:** AI report is accurate, calculations valid, insights reasonable, and recommendations actionable. Minor rounding and completeness improvements recommended. ✅
