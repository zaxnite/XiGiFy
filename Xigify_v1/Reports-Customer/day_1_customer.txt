GEMINI AI ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------
## üöÄ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Director's Room shows reasonable energy usage, but there's room for improvement.  Lights and AC were used while the room was unoccupied for a small percentage of the time.  Automating the AC to switch off when unoccupied could save approximately AED 20 (estimated) annually, while better integration between the AC and window sensor could yield additional savings.

## üå°Ô∏è HOW IS THE ROOM PERFORMING?

The room's comfort levels are generally good, based on the sensor data. The AC ran for 45% of the day, suggesting a comfortable temperature was maintained most of the time. Energy was used efficiently for the most part, with minimal wasted energy during unoccupied periods (only 5% of the time was AC on while the room was unoccupied, and 2% with lights). There was a small amount of AC use (1%) when a window was open, indicating some potential for improvement. No significant red flags were detected, although some small improvements in energy efficiency are possible.  Benchmark data is not available for comparison.


## üí° ENERGY WASTE: WHERE IS POWER BEING WASTED?

* **Unoccupied cooling:** The AC ran for 5% of the time while the room was unoccupied, which means approximately 4 hours of the AC operating unnecessarily. This may add about AED 20 to the annual energy bill. (Data: AC on: 45%, Occupancy: 50%, AC on while unoccupied: 5%).
* **Unoccupied lighting:**  Lights were left on for 2% of the time the room was empty, a minimal impact. (Data: Lights on: 35%, Occupancy: 50%, Lights on while unoccupied: 2%).
* **AC running with open windows:** In 1% of the time the AC was on while a window was open, which decreases efficiency. This likely has a very minimal effect on the energy bill. (Data: AC on: 45%, Window Open: 5%, AC on while window open: 1%).


## ‚ö†Ô∏è ANY WARNING SIGNS IN THE SYSTEM?

No system issues detected.

## üïí HOW IS THE ROOM BEING USED?

The Director's Room was occupied approximately half the day (50%). The lights and AC were used for significant portions of the day (35% and 45% respectively), suggesting regular use. Windows and doors were opened infrequently (5% and 2% respectively). More detailed usage patterns are available for analysis in the full report.

## üîó WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH SENSORS AND CONTROLS?

The system shows some level of synchronization, as most of the AC and light usage corresponds to occupancy. However, there were instances of AC and light use when unoccupied, and AC running with the window open. There was 1 manual override of the AC. Automation could improve efficiency by aligning AC and light usage directly with occupancy and window status.

## ‚úÖ WHAT CAN BE IMPROVED? (ACTIONABLE NEXT STEPS)

* **Automate AC shutdown when unoccupied:** Implementing an automated system that turns off the AC when the occupancy sensor detects emptiness will save approximately AED 20 annually. (Estimated savings based on current unoccupied AC runtime.)
* **Link AC to window sensor:**  Connecting the AC system to the window sensor will automatically shut off the AC when a window is opened, preventing wasted energy and improving efficiency. This will improve energy efficiency with a minimal impact.
* **Review and optimize light schedules:** Explore options for improving lighting schedules to further reduce energy consumption, possibly through timer-based dimming. This may result in cost savings. (Data: Lights on 35%).
* **Educate occupants on best practices:** Remind occupants to close windows before activating the AC, maximizing cooling efficiency. This will slightly improve efficiency. (Data: AC on while window open: 1%)
* **Analyze full sensor data:** A more detailed analysis of the sensor data, including the full weekly and monthly usage patterns, can provide more specific recommendations for further optimization.
