## 1. 📊 Data Consistency Check

* **Usage percentages:** Light (34%), AC (57%), Fan (30%), Occupancy (49%), Window (9%), Door (3%) match the JSON. ✔️
* **Device cycles:** Light 14/14, AC 14/14, Fan 15/15, Door 55 opens, Occupancy 20 detections match raw counts. ✔️
* **Energy consumption:** Light 1.4 kWh, AC 10.2 kWh, Fan 0.9 kWh correctly reflect the data. ✔️
* **Cross-sensor ratios:** AC on while unoccupied 11%, Light on while unoccupied 4%, AC on while window open 5% match JSON. ✔️
* **Sensor events:** Occupancy sensor signal degradation at 14:02 and manual overrides (AC 4, Fan 2) are correctly noted. ✔️
* **Power drift:** AC drift detected (true), Light drift (false) matches the JSON. ✔️

**Verdict:** Reported values are fully consistent with the raw data.

## 2. ✏️ Calculation & Savings Estimates

* Report estimates AED 200 annual savings from AC automation. This is **an extrapolation from the 11% daily unoccupied AC runtime**, reasonable but not directly verifiable.
* Monthly cost impact from AC running with windows open (AED 5–10) and lights on unoccupied (minimal) is logically consistent with reported energy usage.

**Verdict:** Estimates are plausible, but the exact annual savings figure is based on assumptions.

## 3. ⚠️ System Issues Identification

* Correctly flagged:

  * AC running while unoccupied (11%) ✔️
  * Lights on while unoccupied (4%) ✔️
  * AC running with windows open (5%) ✔️
  * Occupancy sensor degradation at 14:02 ✔️
  * AC power drift ✔️

**Verdict:** All relevant issues were accurately reported.

---

## 4. 🤔 Assumptions & Interpretations

* Comfort level (“not directly measurable”) is acknowledged as an assumption—good practice. ✔️
* Energy waste calculations are mostly data-driven, with minor assumptions on cost conversion (AED/month).
* AC/window coordination inefficiency inferred from cross-sensor ratio (5%) is reasonable. ✔️

**Verdict:** Minimal assumptions; largely data-based conclusions.

---

## 5. 💡 Recommendations

* **Automate AC shutoff:** Correctly suggested to reduce wasted energy. ✔️
* **Integrate window sensors:** Accurate recommendation. ✔️
* **Inspect/replace occupancy sensor:** Matches the degradation event. ✔️
* **Investigate AC power drift:** Correct recommendation based on drift flag. ✔️
* **Review manual overrides:** Helpful for optimizing automation and energy efficiency. ✔️

**Verdict:** Recommendations are actionable, relevant, and supported by the data.

## 6. ✅ Overall Assessment

* **Accuracy:** \~95% correct (data values, issues, recommendations).
* **Minor Caveats:**

  * Savings extrapolation (AED 200) is an estimate.
  * Monthly cost conversions assume linear scaling from daily percentages.

**Conclusion:** The report is reliable, data-driven, and provides useful actionable steps with minor extrapolation-based assumptions.
