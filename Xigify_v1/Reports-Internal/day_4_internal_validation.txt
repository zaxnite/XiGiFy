## 1. DATA EXTRACTION ACCURACY

* **Timestamps:** Correct (`2025-08-14T00:00:00+08:00` to `2025-08-14T23:59:59+08:00`). ✅
* **Usage Patterns:** Matches JSON:

  * Light: 34% ✅
  * AC: 57% ✅
  * Fan: 30% ✅
  * Occupancy: 49% ✅
  * Window open: 9% ✅
  * Door open: 3% ✅
* **Efficiency Metrics / Cross-Sensor Ratios:** Correct. ✅
* **Energy Consumption:** Matches JSON:

  * Light: 1.4 kWh ✅
  * AC: 10.2 kWh ✅
  * Fan: 0.9 kWh ✅
  * Total: 12.5 kWh ✅ (sum rounded correctly)
* **Device Activity:** Matches JSON:

  * Light: 14/14 ✅
  * AC: 14/14 ✅
  * Fan: 15/15 ✅
  * Door events: 55 opens ✅
  * Occupancy events: 20 detections ✅
  * Window events: Reported 9% open vs JSON counts 8/8; minor rounding discrepancy ⚠️
* **Run Length Statistics:** Average runtimes match JSON; variance not reported in the main report but present in JSON. ⚠️
* **Power Drift / Anomalies:** Correctly reports AC drift True, Light drift False. ✅
* **Seasonal Patterns / Intervals:** Correct. ✅
* **Sensor Health:** Correctly flags occupancy sensor signal degradation. ✅
* **Manual Overrides:** AC: 4, Fan: 2 ✅

**Summary:** Data extraction is accurate (\~95–97%). Minor issues: window event count vs %. Variance values omitted in the report.

## 2. CALCULATION VALIDITY

* **Wasted energy calculations:**

  * AC unoccupied: 10.2 × 0.11 = 1.122 kWh ✅
  * Lights unoccupied: 1.4 × 0.04 = 0.056 kWh ✅
  * AC while window open: 10.2 × 0.05 = 0.51 kWh ✅
* All calculations verified correct. ✅

---

## 3. SENSOR HEALTH & ANOMALY HANDLING

* **Sensor health:** Occupancy signal degradation correctly reported. ✅
* **Power drift:** Correctly flagged for AC. ✅
* **Other anomaly flags:** AC rapid cycling, light stuck, occupancy stuck all correctly False. ✅

---

## 4. LOGICAL CONSISTENCY & HALLUCINATIONS

* **Runtime and cycle interpretations:** AC runtime longer than light/fan flagged for investigation; reasonable inference. ✅
* **Event interval interpretations:** P99 values interpreted as potential outliers; logical. ✅
* **Other behavioral analyses:** Consistent with JSON. ✅

---

## 5. ANALYTICAL SOUNDNESS

* **Energy inefficiency insights:** Accurate and actionable. ✅
* **Behavioral / correlation insights:** Correct; correlation noted without implying causation. ✅
* **Recommendations:** Align with data:

  * Energy savings (AC unoccupied, AC with windows, lights unoccupied)
  * System optimization (AC runtime, cycle count, power drift)
  * Maintenance (occupancy sensor)
  * Automation improvements
  * User behavior feedback

---

## 6. FINAL VERDICT

* **Overall accuracy:** \~95–97%
* **Reliability:** Report is reliable; minor rounding issues and omission of variance should be addressed for completeness.
* **Critical errors:** None.
* **Minor improvements:**

  * Include variance for run length statistics.
  * Clarify % vs raw counts for window events (8 counts = 9%).

**Conclusion:** The Day 4 report is largely accurate, clear, and actionable. Minor numerical refinements recommended for precision and completeness.
