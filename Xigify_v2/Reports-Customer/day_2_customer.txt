INTERPRETATION DATA SUMMARY:
------------------------------------------------------------
Efficiency Score: 38.11
Total Energy: 10.95 kWh
Comfort Score: 77.33
Manual Overrides: 2
System Health Events: 1

DETERMINISTIC INTERPRETATION:
------------------------------------------------------------
ENERGY EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS:
Energy performance is poor.  The main area for improvement is reducing wasted energy from air conditioning.

COMFORT & WELLBEING ANALYSIS:
The room's comfort level is adequate.  Improving the relationship between lighting and occupancy would enhance comfort.

PREDICTIVE INSIGHTS ANALYSIS:
The system is relatively stable, but air conditioning usage is increasing.  It's recommended to monitor this trend closely.

DETERMINISTIC RULES:
------------------------------------------------------------
ENERGY EFFICIENCY RULES:
  • ENERGY_RULE_1: MEDIUM - Optimize AC scheduling to reduce unoccupied runtime (device ratio: 0.48) and implement occupancy-based lighting controls;
  • ENERGY_RULE_2: MEDIUM - Monitor fan usage efficiency (current ratio: 0.21) to identify energy optimization opportunities;
  • ENERGY_RULE_3: MEDIUM - Maintain current energy performance baseline and schedule periodic efficiency reviews

COMFORT & WELLBEING RULES:
  • COMFORT_RULE_1: MEDIUM - Optimize occupancy-light alignment to exceed 75% (current: 69.2%);
  • COMFORT_RULE_2: MEDIUM - Maintain AC runtime stability at current level (0.78) and monitor temperature control;
  • COMFORT_RULE_3: LOW - Schedule quarterly comfort assessment reviews and minor system calibrations
