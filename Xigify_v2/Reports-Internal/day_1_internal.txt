INTERPRETATION DATA SUMMARY:
------------------------------------------------------------
Efficiency Score: 40.73
Total Energy: 10.3 kWh
Comfort Score: 77.83
Manual Overrides: 1
System Health Events: 0

DETERMINISTIC INTERPRETATION:
------------------------------------------------------------
ENERGY EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS:
The overall energy performance is poor, with an efficiency score of 40.73. The primary source of energy waste is attributed to unoccupied AC runtime (0.05) and lighting (0.02), contributing to a total waste score of 0.15.

COMFORT & WELLBEING ANALYSIS:
The overall comfort level is adequate, with a comfort score of 77.83.  The primary area for improvement is optimizing occupancy-light alignment, currently at 70.0%, to enhance user experience.

PREDICTIVE INSIGHTS ANALYSIS:
The system stability status is stable, with no drift detection flags or significant system health events reported.  The recommended action priority is low, given the absence of any detected anomalies or concerning trends.

DETERMINISTIC RULES:
------------------------------------------------------------
ENERGY EFFICIENCY RULES:
  • ENERGY_RULE_1: MEDIUM - Optimize AC scheduling to reduce unoccupied runtime (device ratio: 0.45) and implement occupancy-based lighting controls;
  • ENERGY_RULE_2: MEDIUM - Monitor fan usage efficiency (current ratio: 0.2) to identify energy optimization opportunities;
  • ENERGY_RULE_3: MEDIUM - Maintain current energy performance baseline and schedule periodic efficiency reviews

COMFORT & WELLBEING RULES:
  • COMFORT_RULE_1: MEDIUM - Optimize occupancy-light alignment to exceed 75% (current: 70.0%);
  • COMFORT_RULE_2: MEDIUM - Maintain AC runtime stability at current level (0.789) and monitor temperature control;
  • COMFORT_RULE_3: LOW - Schedule quarterly comfort assessment reviews and minor system calibrations
